# Valentine with Python 

`Valentines with Python` is a mini fun project I have coded. If you’re a programmer, you can surprise your valentine with this awesome and fun project. This program generates an animation of a heart with cool texts of your loved one. It also generates the `.png` and `.gif` files of the animation. The piece is coded in python and uses some of the important python libraries. The following libraries are required to be installed to run this project.
